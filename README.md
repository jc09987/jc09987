👋 Hi, I’m Juan Carlos!

👀 I’m interested in architectures living in the internet that can be used in several industries for several different purposes!
Front-end development is my main approach but I have a lot of expertise in Back-end dev, testing, DBs and a little of CI/CD/Dockerization.

🌱 I’m currently learning about what's new in my favorite frameworks/methodologies and what can I do to enchance what we already have.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on teams focused on results, trust and companionship
